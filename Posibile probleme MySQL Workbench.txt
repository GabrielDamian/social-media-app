Fix for: Client does not support authentication protocol requested by server;
run in workbench: 
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'root';

Disable safe mode(allow you delete * from table_name; //without where clause)
Edit->preferences > sql editor -> uncheck safe mode (last checkbox)
Query->Reconnect to the server
